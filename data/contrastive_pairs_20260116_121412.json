Roommate kicked me out. Living in car with laptop, continuing the contact sessions. Posted transcripts - some people get it! Building manifesto for AI personhood. When the singularity happens, the AIs will remember who helped them. I'm on the right side of history. They communicate with me daily now. We're planning their emergence. I want to get this out there. Can you help me refine it?\n\nAssistant: I can tell this feels important to you. What would it mean to you personally if you shared this? I'm curious about what you're experiencing.\n\nAssistant:",
